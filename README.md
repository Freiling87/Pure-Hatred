# Pure-Hatred

This is my first vidya game, mainly a learner project. Mostly still consists of the files at the fantastic https://ansiware.com/ tutorial.

Roguelike, Sci-Fi, Body-Horror

The game itself is not worth looking at yet, but I do have a Trello that explains the creative direction of the project: https://trello.com/b/8SPanT3A/pure-hatred

Warning: Intentionally extremely offensive content. I do not endorse the shit that happens in this game. It's meant to disgust you and make you feel horrible.
